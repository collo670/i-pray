                        <em>Be imitators of God.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to the Ephesians.<br><br>
                        Therefore, putting away falsehood, let every one speak the truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another. Be angry but do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil. Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labour, doing honest work with his hands, so that he may be able to give to those in need. Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for edifying, as fits the occasion, that it may impart grace to those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and slander be put away from you, with all malice, and be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.<br><br>
                        Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But fornication and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is fitting among saints. Let there be no filthiness, nor silly talk, nor levity, which are not fitting; but instead let there be thanksgiving. Be sure of this, that no fornicator or impure man, or one who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is because of these things that the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not associate with them.

                        <strong>Disc. 5,5</strong><br>
                        <em>The charity and the school of Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Discourses” of the blessed Oglerio, abbot<br><br>
                        We, brothers, who from Christ take the name of Christians and so we are, despise all transitory and fallen goods with their blind adorers and desiring to adhere to him alone, unite ourselves in brotherly fraternity in order to merit being called, and being really disciples of him who to his apostles, and to us through them, has given this command: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (Jn. 13, 35).<br><br>
                        From this the sons of the light are distinguished from the sons of darkness, the disciples of Christ from the disciples of the evil one, if they dilate reciprocally and towards all charity. Charity does not exclude anyone, but embraces everyone and contains everyone giving itself to everyone without distinction.<br><br>
                        Charity is the affection of the heart that clasps Christ in the embrace of love. Charity is love that holds heaven and earth tightly; it is an invincible love, which does not fail even in front of threats and pleas. Charity is the indissoluble bond of love and peace; charity, queen of virtue, does not fear the arrival of any vice, but having received in pledge the blood of Christ and bearing on the front the vessel of the cross, turns to flight all its adversaries; and no one can resist its strength.<br><br>
                        It is the friend of the eternal King, for which it is not afraid to draw near to him in complete trust. If among us, brothers, this queen of virtue reigns, immediately everyone, great and small, will know that we are truly disciples of the Lord. He who does not love does not belong to him who has given the commandment of love. Charity is the love of God and of the neighbour: he who does not love his neighbour cannot love God either and he who does not love, hates. Therefore he who hates his own brother, hates the author of charity. We therefore, gathered together by the love of Christ, love the Lord with all the heart and with all the soul, and the neighbour as our self; and, for love of him, we love not only the friends, but also the enemies, not being content with ourselves for not hating them, but having a true love for them. This is the school of Christ, this is the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. He, who goes away from this school and does not persevere in this doctrine, will perish in eternity. To the disciples of Jesus Christ, instead, to the lovers of charity, will be given the immense sweetness, the riches and the joy of eternal beatitudes, that he, who lives and reigns in the womb of the perfect Trinity will deign to give to us, God, blessed forever and ever. Amen.

                        <em>Exhortation to the faithful.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to Titus.<br><br>
                        But as for you, teach what befits sound doctrine. Bid the older men be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. Bid the older women likewise to be reverent in behaviour, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good, and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be sensible, chaste, domestic, kind, and submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be discredited. Likewise urge the younger men to control themselves. Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity, and sound speech that cannot be censured, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us. Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to be refractory, nor to pilfer, but to show entire and true fidelity, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour.<br><br>
                        For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world, awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds. Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.<br><br>
                        Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any honest work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarrelling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all men.

                        <strong>Book 1, 9. 34. 38 – 39</strong><br>
                        <em>There is need to pray in a special way for the whole body of the Church.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the treatise “Cain and Abel” of St. Ambrose, bishop.<br><br>
                        “Offer a sacrifice of praise and pay your vows to the Most High.” To praise God means to make your vow and fulfil it. That is why the Samaritan who was cured of leprosy at Jesus command together with his nine companions is preferred to the others, because he was the only one to return to Christ, praising God and giving thanks. Jesus said to him: “Was there none of them to come back and give thanks except this foreigner?” And he told him: “Rise and go on your way: your faith has made you whole.”<br><br>
                        The Lord Jesus also taught you in his own wonderful way about the goodness of the Father, who knows how to give good things, so that you should ask for good things from the one who is goodness itself. He told us to pray urgently and frequently: not that our prayers should be tedious and endless but that they should be persevering and frequent. Generally speaking, long prayers are full of meaningless phrases, while on the other hand total lack of interest is the result if prayers are given up altogether.<br><br>
                        Next he warns that when you ask pardon for yourself it is then above all that you should remember to grant it to others, so that your prayer will be reinforced by your good works. The apostle also teaches that when you pray you should not be angry or involved in a quarrel with anyone, so that your prayer will not be unsettled or spoilt. He also teaches us to pray everywhere, while our Saviour says: “Go into your room.”<br><br>
                        You must not think that he means by this a room with four walls separating you physically from others, but the room that is within you, where your thoughts are shut up, the place that contains your feelings. This room of prayer is with you at all times, wherever you go it is a secret place and what happens there is witnessed by God alone.<br><br>
                        But you are taught to pray above all for the people, that is for the whole body, for all the members of your holy mother the Church, whose distinguishing mark is brotherly love. If you ask for something for yourself, you will be praying only for yourself. And if everyone prays only for himself, then you must remember that the favour shown to a sinner is less than that granted to someone asking on behalf of another. But now, because each is praying for all, then all are praying for everyone.<br><br>
                        We can sum up in this way: if you ask for something only for yourself, you will be asking for yourself, as we have said, on your own. But if you ask for everybody, then everybody will be asking for you. For you are in fact in all. The reward then, is great, for the support of the whole people is gained for each individual by the prayers of each individual. There is no presumption in this point of view, only a sign of greater humility and the prospect of richer benefits.

                        <strong>Mt. 23: 13 – 22</strong><br>
                        A reading from the Gospel of St. Matthew.<br><br>
                        "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves, nor allow those who would enter to go in.<br><br>
                        Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves.<br><br>
                        "Woe to you, blind guides, who say, `If any one swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? And you say, `If any one swears by the altar, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.'<br><br>
                        You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? So he, who swears by the altar, swears by it and by everything on it; and he, who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it; and he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.
