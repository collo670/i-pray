                        <em>The judgement of God on Judah and Israel.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the prophet Amos.<br><br>
                        Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,
                        I will not revoke the punishment; because they have rejected the law of the
                        LORD, and have not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them astray,
                        after which their fathers walked. So I will send a fire upon Judah, and it
                        shall devour the strongholds of Jerusalem."<br><br>
                        Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,
                        I will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver,
                        and the needy for a pair of shoes -- they that trample the head of the poor
                        into the dust of the earth, and turn aside the way of the afflicted; a man and
                        his father go in to the same maiden, so that my holy name is profaned; they
                        lay themselves down beside every altar upon garments taken in pledge; and
                        in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.<br><br>
                        "Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height
                        of the cedars, and who was as strong as the oaks; I destroyed his fruit
                        above, and his roots beneath. Also I brought you up out of the land of
                        Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the
                        Amorite. And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your
                        young men for Nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?" says the
                        LORD. "But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and commanded the
                        prophets, saying, `You shall not prophesy.' "Behold, I will press you down
                        in your place, as a cart full of sheaves presses down. Flight shall perish
                        from the swift, and the strong shall not retain his strength, nor shall the
                        mighty save his life; he who handles the bow shall not stand, and he who is
                        swift of foot shall not save himself, nor shall he who rides the horse save his
                        life; and he who is stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in
                        that day," says the LORD.

                        <strong>Cc. 2: 6 – 10; 3: 1, 3, 4, 10 – 16</strong><br>
                        <em>The new law of our Lord.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter” attributed to Barnabas.<br><br>
                        He has therefore abolished the old sacrifices, so that the new law of our
                        Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of constriction, might have an
                        offering that is not work of men. And again He says to them, “Did I
                        command your fathers, when they went out from the land of Egypt, to offer
                        unto me burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But this rather I commanded them,
                        Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against his neighbour, and
                        love not an oath of falsehood.” We ought therefore, being possessed of
                        understanding, to perceive the gracious intention of our Father; for He
                        speaks to us, desirous that we, not going astray like them, should ask how
                        we may approach Him. To us, then, He declares, “A sacrifice [pleasing] to
                        God is a broken spirit; a smell of sweet savour to the Lord is a heart that
                        glorifies Him that made it.” We ought therefore, brethren, carefully to
                        inquire concerning our salvation, lest the Wicked one, having made his
                        entrance by deceit, should hurl us forth from our [true] life. He says then to
                        them again concerning these things, “Why do you fast to me as on this day,
                        says the Lord, that your voice should be heard with a cry? I have not chosen
                        this fast, says the Lord, that a man should humble his soul? Is it to bend
                        your neck like a reed, and put upon you sackcloth and ashes? Will you call
                        it an acceptable fast.” To us He says,
                        “Behold, this is the fast that I have chosen, says the Lord, not that a
                        man should humble his soul, but that he should loose every band of iniquity,
                        untie the fastenings of harsh agreements, restore to liberty them that are
                        bruised, tear in pieces every unjust engagement, feed the hungry with your
                        bread, clothe the naked when you see him, bring the homeless into your
                        house, let us utterly hate the works of the way of wickedness. Do not, by
                        retiring apart, live a solitary life, as if you were already [fully] justified; but
                        coming together in one place, make common inquiry concerning what tends
                        to your general welfare. For the Scripture says, “Woe to them who are wise
                        to themselves, and prudent in their own sight!” Let us be spiritually minded:
                        let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us meditate upon
                        the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may
                        rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of
                        persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his
                        righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of wickedness is
                        before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called
                        [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring
                        power over us, should thrust us away from the kingdom of the Lord. And all
                        the more attend to this, my brethren, when you reflect and behold, that after
                        so great signs and wonders were wrought in Israel, they were thus [at length]
                        abandoned. Let us beware lest we be found [fulfilling that saying], as it is
                        written, “Many are called, but few are chosen.”

                        presence of God who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus who in his
                        testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you to
                        keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the
                        appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; and this will be made manifest at the
                        proper time by the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord
                        of lords, who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light,
                        whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honour and eternal
                        dominance. Amen.<br><br>
                        As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set
                        their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with
                        everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal
                        and generous, thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the
                        future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed.<br><br>
                        O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the godless
                        chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, for by
                        professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith. Grace be with
                        you.

                        <em>Do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter to the Ephesians” of St. Ignatius of Antioch,
                        bishop and martyr.<br><br>
                        But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the
                        name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practice things
                        unworthy of God, and hold opinions contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to
                        their own destruction, and that of those who give credit to them, whom you
                        must avoid as you would wild beasts. For “the righteous man who avoids
                        them is saved for ever; but the destruction of the ungodly is sudden, and a
                        subject of rejoicing.” For “they are dumb dogs, that cannot bark,” raving
                        mad, and biting secretly, against whom you must be on your guard, since
                        they labour under an incurable disease. But our Physician is the only true
                        God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and
                        Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our
                        God, Jesus the Christ, the only begotten Son and Word, before time began,
                        but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For “the Word
                        was made flesh.” Being incorporeal, He was in the body; being impassable,
                        He was in a passable body; being immortal, He was in a mortal body; being
                        life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from
                        death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when
                        they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.<br><br>
                        Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed you are not deceived; for
                        you are wholly devoted to God. For when there is no evil desire within you,
                        which might defile and torment you, then do you live in accordance with
                        the will of God, and are [the servants] of Christ. Cast out that which defiles
                        you, who are of the most holy Church of the Ephesians, which is so famous
                        and celebrated throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those
                        things that are spiritual, or they that are spiritual the things which are carnal;
                        even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of
                        faith. But you, being full of the Holy Spirit, do nothing according to the
                        flesh, but all things according to the Spirit. You are complete in Christ
                        Jesus, “who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.”<br><br>
                        Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you,
                        holding the wicked doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom you did
                        not allow entrance to sow their discord but stopped your ears that you might
                        not receive that error which was proclaimed by them, as being persuaded
                        that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of
                        Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not
                        speak His own things, but those of Christ, and that not from himself, but
                        from the Lord; even as the Lord also announced to us the things that He
                        received from the Father. For, says He, “the word that you hear is not mine,
                        but the Father’s, who sent me.” And says He of the Holy Spirit, “He shall
                        not speak of Himself, but whatsoever things He shall hear from me.” And
                        He says of Himself to the Father, “I have,” says He, “glorified You upon the
                        earth; I have finished the work which, You gave Me; I have manifested
                        Your name to men.” And of the Holy Spirit, “He shall glorify me, for He
                        receives of mine.” But the spirit of deceit preaches himself, and speaks his
                        own things, for he seeks to please himself. He glorifies himself, for he is
                        full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent, soothing, flattering, treacherous,
                        rhapsodical, trifling, inharmonious, verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his
                        power Jesus Christ will deliver you, who has founded you upon the rock, as
                        being chosen stones, well fitted for the divine edifice of the Father, and who
                        are raised up on high by Christ, who was crucified for you, making use of
                        the Holy Spirit as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by love
                        from earth to heaven, walking in company with those that are undefiled.<br><br>
                        For, says [the Scripture], “Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in
                        the law of the Lord.” Now the way is unerring, namely, Jesus Christ. For,
                        says He, “I am the way and the life.” And this way leads to the Father. For
                        “no man,” says He, “comes to the Father but by me.” Blessed, then, are you
                        who are God-bearers, spirit-bearers, temple-bearers, bearers of holiness,
                        adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being “a
                        royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people that God has acquired,” on whose
                        account I rejoice exceedingly, and have had the privilege, by this Epistle, of
                        conversing with “the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful in Christ
                        Jesus.” I rejoice, therefore, over you, that you do not give heed to vanity,
                        and love nothing according to the flesh, but according to God.

                        A reading from the Gospel of St. Luke.<br><br>
                        And he went down to Caper'na-um, a city of Galilee. And he was
                        teaching them on the Sabbath; and they were astonished at his teaching, for
                        his word was with authority.<br><br>
                        And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an
                        unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, "Ah! What have you to
                        do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who
                        you are, the Holy One of God." But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent,
                        and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the
                        midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. And they were all
                        amazed and said to one another, "What is this word? For with authority and
                        power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out." And reports
                        of him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
