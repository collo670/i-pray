                        <em>Riches and poverty.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the First Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to Timothy.<br>
                        As for the rich in this world, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on uncertain riches but on God who richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good deeds, liberal and generous, thus laying up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the life which is life indeed. O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the godless chatter and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge, for by professing it some have missed the mark as regards the faith. Grace be with you.

                        <strong>Nm. 7 – 9</strong><br>
                        <em>Do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter to the Ephesians” of St. Ignatius of Antioch, bishop and martyr.<br>
                        But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practice things contrary to the faith. But you, being full of the Holy Spirit, do nothing according to the flesh, but all things according to the Spirit. You are complete in Christ Jesus, “who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.” Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you, holding the wicked doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom you did not allow entrance to sow their discord but stopped your ears that you might not receive that error which was proclaimed by them, as being persuaded that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of God. For truly, as the captain of a ship, when he perceives the wind adverse, and the sea tempestuous, and his ship in danger of being wrecked, then casts out the cargo, and lightens the vessel, and so escapes; so also, if any one, when he hears the doctrine of the strange and evil spirit, should not stop his ears, but should receive it, he would be cast out of the Church of God. Therefore, my dearly beloved, do not receive any one who speaks anything contrary to the faith, but stop your ears, and do not receive him, that you may not be cast out of the kingdom of God. For if you receive him, you will be cast out. For the Lord says, “He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man’s reward.” But if you receive a false prophet, you will be cast out with him. For “by their fruits you shall know them.” You therefore, being adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being “a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people that God has acquired,” on whose account I rejoice exceedingly, and have had the privilege, by this Epistle, of conversing with “the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus.” I rejoice, therefore, over you, that you do not give heed to vanity, and love nothing according to the flesh, but according to God.

                        A reading from the psalms.<br>
                        O come, let us sing to the LORD; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. The sea is his, for he made it; and his hands formed the dry land. O come, let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker! For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as at Mer'ibah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, when your fathers tested me, and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. For forty years I loathed that generation and said, "They are a people who err in heart, and they do not regard my ways." Therefore I swore in my anger that they should not enter my rest.

                        <strong>Cc. 2: 6 – 10; 3: 1, 3, 4, 10 – 16</strong><br>
                        <em>The new law of our Lord.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter” attributed to Barnabas.<br>
                        He has therefore abolished the old sacrifices, so that the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of constriction, might have an offering that is not work of men. And again He says to them, “Did I command your fathers, when they went out from the land of Egypt, to offer unto me burnt-offerings and sacrifices? But this rather I commanded them, saying, ‘Let no one of you cherish any evil in his heart against his neighbour, and love not an oath which is false.’” For this is the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is without the yoke of constriction. For he says, “This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their mind, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.” And again he says, “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, says the Lord: but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, says the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people; and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, says the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” Therefore, my brethren, let us be zealous for that good thing which is eternal, and let us not be led away by the error of the unbelievers. For they who are the called of God, and who have been chosen according to His purpose, are not called according to their works, but according to His foreknowledge and mercy. For He says, “I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.” Therefore He hath mercy on whom He will, and whom He will He hardeneth. Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth He still find fault? For who hath resisted His will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? What if God, willing to shew His wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: and that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory, even us, whom He hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? As He saith also in Osee, “I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called the children of the living God.” Let us therefore be spiritually minded: let us be a perfect temple to God. As much as in us lies, let us meditate upon the fear of God, and let us keep His commandments, that we may rejoice in His ordinances. The Lord will judge the world without respect of persons. Each will receive as he has done: if he is righteous, his righteousness will precede him; if he is wicked, the reward of wickedness is before him. Take heed, lest resting at our ease, as those who are the called [of God], we should fall asleep in our sins, and the wicked prince, acquiring power over us, should lead us away from the living God.

                        And he went down to Caper'na-um, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath; and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority. And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon; and he cried out with a loud voice, "Ah! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God." But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!" And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. And they were all amazed and said to one another, "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out." And reports of him went out into every place in the surrounding region.
