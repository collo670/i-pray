                        <strong>Eph. 4: 1 – 16</strong><br>
                        <em>The Body of Christ is constructed in unity.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to the Ephesians.<br>
                        I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all lowliness and meekness, with patience, forbearing one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all. But grace was given to each of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it is said, "When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men." (In saying, "He ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is he who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; So that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by every joint with which it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth and builds itself up in love.

                        <strong>Book 4, c. 6</strong><br>
                        <em>Behold which sure hope of salvation has been given to the believers.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the treatise “On Matthew” of St. Pascasio Ratberto, abbot.<br>
                        If really you are united to the body of Christ, all the others together will assume you in their prayers, and at the same time they will pray so that in you will be fulfilled the will of the Father. For this the unity must not be an object of little consideration, nor should such a firm communion in Christ be held in such little account in which one is the voice of all, and all united in one unique faith possess God in the heart, love him with the same charity and already enjoy him through the same hope; and all together ask and search for but only one thing and knock on the same door of goodness. Nothing therefore is more valid, richer in grace, more convenient, than that all are only one thing, and all keep vigil on each other, just as each one looks after all, so that all together are found one in Christ. It is exactly in the name of this faith, of this hope and of this love, that he teaches that no one of the faithful should separate himself from that unity. No one therefore should despair of obtaining from the Father that which the only begotten Son teaches us to ask; no one should leave out because of slothfulness the works that are proper of the children, as he teaches us. This is the power that he has given to men, to become children of God (cfr. Jn. 1,13). For this he precedes the work of power, because from it comes the adoption of our liberty. For this he gives us the boldness of praying with the prayer that he gave and taught us, so that the grace could make up for our insufficiency. For this every time that one of us, even though far away from the others and hidden in the most remote places, calls God with the name of the Father, he understands that the gift of such a great grace is conceded not separately to the single individuals, but to all the community of men. No one therefore should glory in saying: My Father who are in heaven, but “Our Father” (Mt. 6, 9), because that expression belongs only to Christ of whom God is the Father in a unique way. For this in another place he says expressively: “I go up to my Father”, then he adds, “and your Father” (Jn. 20, 17). With these words he indicates with sufficient distinction that to him should be given a special glory since he is the Son by nature, while to all the others together is conceded freely the grace of adoption as children. It is manifested therefore in the first case the consubstantialization of the nature, in the other the goodness of the Lord, while both enjoy in common the name of paternity. In this way we are taught that in so much as we are washed by the same water of baptism, we have to be all brothers in him, and reciprocally united by the bond of fraternity. Look how the prayer that the heavenly master of life has taught us should be esteemed sure and holy; look how much we can be blessed, if we keep it not only proclaiming it with the mouth, but also living it with faithfulness; and look what sure hope of salvation is given to the believers, how great is the love that the Creator diffuses on us, how infinite is the mercy and goodness that is poured out on us, what abundant grace and what gift of trust is conceded to us: precisely us, who have not been worthy servants, dare to call God with the name of Father. It is therefore necessary that we live and behave ourselves as sons of God, in order to demonstrate with works and with our way of living, of being really that which we are called.

                        <em>Sentences on old age.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the book of Ecclesiastes.<br>
                        Light is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to behold the sun. For if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all; but let him remember that the days of darkness will be many. All that comes is vanity. Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth; walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things God will bring you into judgment. Remove vexation from your mind, and put away pain from your body; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity. Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you will say, "I have no pleasure in them"; before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain; in the day when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men are bent, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look through the windows are dimmed, and the doors on the street are shut; when the sound of the grinding is low, and one rises up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low; they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along and desire fails; because man goes to his eternal home, and the mourners go about the streets; before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern, and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity. Besides being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge, weighing and studying and arranging proverbs with great care. The Preacher sought to find pleasing words, and uprightly he wrote words of truth. The sayings of the wise are like goads, and like nails firmly fixed are the collected sayings which are given by one Shepherd. My son, beware of anything beyond these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh. The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

                        A reading from the “Explanations on the Ecclesiastes” of St. Gregory of Agrigento, bishop.<br>
                        “Light” says the Preacher, “is sweet, and it is pleasant for the eyes to behold the sun. For if the light were taken away the world would be unadorned and life would be lifeless. Which is why Moses, who saw God, said, “And God saw the light and said it was good.” Here it is fitting for us to think of that great, true, eternal light that enlightens every man coming into the world,” namely Christ our Saviour, the Redeemer of the world, who was made man and came to the last extremity of the human condition. Of him the prophet David says,” Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides upon the clouds; his name is the Lord, exult before him.” He, too, called the light sweet and foretold that it would be good to see with the eyes the sun of glory, he who in the time of his divine incarnation said, “I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.” And again, “This is judgement, that the light has come into the world.” In this way, by means of the light of the sun that we see with our bodily eyes, he foretold the spiritual Sun of justice. That was indeed most sweet for those who were found worthy to be taught by him and to see him with their own eyes as any man, living and dealing with men, even though he was not just any man. He was indeed the true God and hence brought it about that the blind saw, the lame walked, the deaf heard, he cleansed those afflicted with leprosy, and by a simple command called the dead back to life. But now it is most sweet to gaze on him with the eyes of the spirit and to contemplate and ponder over his divine beauty that is not possible for man to see. Then, by means of this communion and mutual sharing, to be enlightened and adorned; to be filled with the sweetness of the spirit and clothed in sanctity; to attain to understanding and finally to be filled with divine exultation which lasts all the days of this present life. The wise Preacher made this point when he said, “For if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all.” Clearly, for those who gaze on him, the Son of justice is the source of all joy. Of him David the prophet said,” Let them exult before God; let them be jubilant with joy!” and again, “Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright.”

                    <em>They say and do not do.</em><br><br>
                    A reading from the Gospel of St. Matthew.<br>
                    Then said Jesus to the crowds and to his disciples, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat; so practice and observe whatever they tell you, but not what they do; for they preach, but do not practice. They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger. They do all their deeds to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the place of honour at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the market places, and being called rabbi by men. But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brethren. And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Neither be called masters, for you have one master, the Christ. He who is greatest among you shall be your servant; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."
