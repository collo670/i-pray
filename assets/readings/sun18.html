                        But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked that he might die, saying, "It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers." And he lay down and slept under a broom tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, "Arise and eat." And he looked, and behold, at his head there was a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again. And the angel of the LORD came again a second time, and touched him, and said, "Arise and eat, else the journey will be too great for you." And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God.

                        <strong>St. Augustine, Serm. 227, 1-2</strong><br>
                        <em>Christ is the bread of life.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the "Sermons" of St. Augustine, bishop.<br>
                        “They who eat me will hunger for more, they who drink me will thirst for more” (Sir. 24: 20). In the present time we cannot nourish ourselves with Christ, wisdom of God, up to the point of satisfying our desire, but remaining with the desire of satisfying ourselves; and all the more we taste his sweetness, the more our desire is heightened. Therefore those who eat will hunger for more, until they reach satiety. When the desire of the good will be satisfied they will not have either hunger or thirst anymore. What has been said can also be applied to the future life: “They who eat me will hunger for more, they who drink me will thirst for more”. There is in fact in that eternal satiety, as a longing, coming not from destitution but from beatitudes: in heaven those who do not need anymore to eat desire always to eat, they are never nauseated by their satiety. There is in fact satiety without nuisance and a desire without agony. Christ, who is always marvellous in his majesty, constitutes unceasingly the object of our desire, he in whom “even the angels long to catch a glimpse” (1 Pet. 1: 12). This is why though possessing him, we desire him and also when we have reached him we continue to search for him, as it is written: “Search for his face always” (Ps. 104: 4). We search continuously for he whom we love in order to be possessed by him eternally. Therefore those who find him continue to search for him, those who eat of him are still hungry, and those who drink of him are still thirsty; but this hunger takes away all other hungers and this thirst extinguishes all other thirsts. It does not torment, it delights.

                        The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, `I have come down from heaven'?" Jesus answered them, "Do not murmur among yourselves. No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the prophets, `And they shall all be taught by God.' Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me. Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father. Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."

                        <strong>St. Cyril of Alexandria, In Ioannem, 4, 2</strong><br>
                        <em>Christ, the living bread.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the "Commentary on the Gospel of John" of St. Cyril of Alexandria.<br>
                        “I am the living bread which came down from heaven” (Jn. 6: 51). Since the guests of my Father were destroyed by death because of the prohibited food that their parents had eaten, and their souls are in hell, the bodies instead in the tombs, I also who am the bread of angels will be destroyed. And with that substance of which the angels are nourished I will descend into the underworld, where the souls are hungry, while with the body I will rest hidden for three days and three nights in the same womb of the earth in which their bodies are buried, as Jonah remained three days and three nights in the belly of the sea mammal. In this way their souls will be recreated in the sight of God and many bodies will rise now; all the others certainly in the future. Finally, to those who are still in the body down here, this same bread will be offered in a way that is suitable to the living, that is in the true sacrifice of the bread and wine according to the order of Melchizedek. “And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world” (Jn. 6: 51). This is the greatest consolation for the poor, that the Holy Spirit descending on me sends me to evangelise; this will be the greatest and incomparable motive of joy for all the nations spread over the earth, who will ask and will receive from the Father in possession and inheritance.

The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; who say in your heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?" Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, thence I will bring you down, says the LORD.

                        <em>Christ, the new manna.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the "Homilies on the Gospel of Matthew" of St. John Chrysostom.<br>
                        “I am the bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever” (Jn. 6: 51). Since the guests of my Father were destroyed by death because of the prohibited food that their parents had eaten, and their souls are in hell, the bodies instead in the tombs, I also who am the bread of angels will be destroyed. And with that substance of which the angels are nourished I will descend into the underworld, where the souls are hungry, while with the body I will rest hidden for three days and three nights in the same womb of the earth in which their bodies are buried, as Jonah remained three days and three nights in the belly of the sea mammal. In this way their souls will be recreated in the sight of God and many bodies will rise now; all the others certainly in the future. Finally, to those who are still in the body down here, this same bread will be offered in a way that is suitable to the living, that is in the true sacrifice of the bread and wine according to the order of Melchizedek. “And the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world” (Jn. 6: 51). This is the greatest consolation for the poor, that the Holy Spirit descending on me sends me to evangelise; this will be the greatest and incomparable motive of joy for all the nations spread over the earth, who will ask and will receive from the Father in possession and inheritance.
