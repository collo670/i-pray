                        I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.

Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth." But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you, you shall go, and whatever I command you, you shall speak. Be not afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD." Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth. See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."

                        <strong>Book 6</strong><br>
                        <em>Adore God through the true holiness of works and of the conscience.</em><br><br>
                        From the “Books of the Stromata” of Clement of Alexandria.<br>
                        He who journeys towards the Lord in love, even if his dwelling is still visible here on earth, does not remove himself from the earthly life, but detaches his soul from the passions. He lives, but he has crucified his greed and does not dispose anymore of his body to which he permits only the strict necessities, in order not to allow it the occasion for its ruin. How can he who does not lie in evil still have need of strength, since he already possesses the strength of not doing evil? How can he who does not desire earthly things still need to be taught to desire them? How can he who is already detached from the world still need to be taught to detach himself? The true holiness is not in the external works, but in the conscience. For God looks not on the appearance, but on the heart. Therefore, let us adore God not with our lips only, but with our whole heart, with our whole soul, with our whole mind. For the Lord says: "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth." Let us not be like the hypocrites, who appear righteous before men, but are full of iniquity within. For the Lord says: "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." Let us purify our conscience, let us cleanse our heart, let us sanctify our soul, that we may be worthy to enter the holy of holies, where God dwells in the midst of his people.

                            A reading from the Gospel of St. Matthew.<br>
                            Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesare'a Philip'pi, he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of man is?" And they said, "Some say John the Baptist, others say Eli'jah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter replied, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.

                            "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Peter asked, not to limit forgiveness, but to learn its measure. For if he had wished to set a limit, he would not have said "seven times," but "once" or "twice." But by saying "seven times," he showed that he knew forgiveness should be frequent. And the Lord answered, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven." This number is not meant to be counted, but to signify infinity. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so high is the mercy of God above the earth. And as the east is far from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. The Lord does not wish us to keep count of sins, but to keep open the door of mercy. For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Therefore, as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. For we are all debtors to God, and if God has forgiven us the great debt, how can we refuse to forgive the small debts of our brothers? The mercy we show to others is the measure of the mercy we shall receive from God. Let us not be like the servant who, having been forgiven a great debt by his master, went out and seized his fellow servant who owed him a little, and cast him into prison until he should pay. When the master heard of it, he was angry and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.

                            A reading from the Gospel of St. Mark.<br>
                            Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decap'olis. And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him. And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue; and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "E'ph'phatha," that is, "Be opened." And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."

                            <strong>Hom. 18: 1-2</strong><br>
                            <em>The healing of the deaf and mute man.</em><br><br>
                            From the “Homilies on the Gospels” of St. Bede the Venerable, priest.<br>
                            The man who was brought to the Lord was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. This signifies the human race, which, from the time of the first sin, has become deaf to the voice of God and unable to speak the praises of God properly. For sin has closed the ears of our heart, so that we cannot hear the words of eternal life, and has tied the tongue of our soul, so that we cannot utter the confession of faith. But the Lord, taking him aside from the multitude, signifies that he draws the sinner away from the crowd of worldly affairs and the company of bad companions, and leads him into solitude, that he may speak to his heart. He puts his fingers into his ears, which signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit, who opens the ears of our heart to hear the divine mysteries. He spits and touches his tongue, which signifies the word of God, which, coming from the mouth of Christ, the Word of God, heals the tongue of our soul, so that we can speak the truth and praise God. Looking up to heaven, he sighs, showing that the healing of the soul is not by human power, but by the grace of God. And he says, "E'ph'phatha," "Be opened," and immediately the ears are opened and the tongue is loosed. So also, when we are converted to God, our ears are opened to hear his commandments, and our tongue is loosed to confess his name and praise him. And the Lord charges them to tell no one, but they proclaim it all the more, because the work of grace cannot be hidden. For the good that is done in the soul overflows and must be manifested in good works.

                            <strong>Hom. 25: 3-4</strong><br>
                            <em>The fire of the Holy Spirit.</em><br><br>
                            From the “Homilies on the Gospels” of St. Gregory the Great, pope.<br>
                            The Lord says, "I came to cast fire upon the earth." This fire is the fire of the Holy Spirit, which the Lord sent upon the earth at Pentecost. For when the Holy Spirit came, there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. This fire is the love of God, which burns away the chaff of sin and purifies the heart. It is the zeal for the truth, which consumes all falsehood. It is the light of faith, which dispels the darkness of ignorance. The Lord says, "And would that it were already kindled!" Not that he desires the fire to be kindled, for it is already kindled, but that he desires it to spread and increase in the hearts of men. For many receive the fire of the Holy Spirit at baptism, but it grows cold through negligence and the cares of the world. Therefore, the Lord desires that the fire be kindled and kept burning in us by prayer, by good works, by the study of the Scriptures, by participation in the sacraments. The baptism he speaks of is his passion and death on the cross, which he calls a baptism because it is a washing away of sins. And he is constrained until it is accomplished, because he desires to accomplish the work of our salvation. He came not to bring peace, but division, because the truth he brings divides those who accept it from those who reject it. And this division often occurs even in families, when some believe and others do not. But this is not the peace that the world gives, which is the absence of conflict, but the peace that Christ gives, which is the peace of the Kingdom of God, which the world cannot give.
