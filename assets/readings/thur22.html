                        <strong>2 Cor. 4: 7-15</strong><br>
                        <em>The sufferings of the apostle.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Second Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to the Corinthians.<br>
                        But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, "I believed, and so I spoke," we too believe, and so we speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day. So we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being renewed every day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. Therefore, since we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in cunning or falsifying God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God. For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the transcendent power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. For while we live we are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you.

                        <strong>Nm. 13 – 15</strong><br>
                        <em>Nothing is better than having peace in Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter to the Ephesians” of St. Ignatius of Antioch, bishop and martyr.<br>
                        Take heed, then, often to come together to give thanks to God, and show forth His praise. For when you come frequently together in the same place, the powers of Satan are destroyed, and the destruction at which he aims is prevented. For there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son; who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence, and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him. He therefore warns you all, that you be perfectly united among yourselves, and with the bishop, and the presbyters, and the deacons, and the people. For when you are divided in these things, you become profane. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ, they are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. Those who corrupt families shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If, then, those who do this as respects earthly things are condemned, how much more shall this be the case with him who corrupts by wicked doctrine the faith of God, for which Jesus Christ was crucified! Such an one becoming defiled in this, shall go away into everlasting fire, and so also the one who listens to him. Unless, therefore, ye be united together in the same mind, and in the same judgment regarding the same things, and unless ye all agree respecting the same rule of conduct, and unless ye all join in the same thanksgiving, and in the same prayer to God, and in the same things which are becoming to God, ye cannot attain to that which is laid up for you. For it is better that you should be silent and so be reckoned a fool, than that you should speak and so be proved to be one. For as a man is, so also he speaks; and he who is wise in word is also wise in heart. For the Lord says, "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." Wherefore, as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ, they are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. For where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the Church, and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Wherefore, as many as are not of God and of Jesus Christ, they are of the devil. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ, they are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. For where the Church is, there is the Spirit of God; and where the Spirit of God is, there is the Church, and every kind of grace; but the Spirit is truth. Wherefore, as many as are not of God and of Jesus Christ, they are of the devil.

                        A reading from the “Letter” attributed to Barnabas.<br>
                        The way of light, then, is as follows. If any one desires to travel to the appointed place, he must be zealous in his works. The knowledge, therefore, which is given to us for the purpose of walking in this way, is the following. You shall love Him that created you: you shall glorify Him that redeemed you from death. You shall be simple in heart, and rich in spirit. You shall not join yourself to those who walk in the way of death. You shall hate doing what is unpleasing to God: You shall hate all hypocrisy. You shall not forsake the commandments of the Lord. You shall not exalt yourself, but shall be humble and lowly in spirit. You shall not cleave to men of high reputation, but to the humble and lowly. You shall receive as good things whatever happens to you, knowing that nothing is done without God. You shall be long-suffering, merciful, and blameless, mild, and good. You shall not follow after your own lusts and pleasures, but shall be modest. You shall be a lover of that which is good, and shall reprove no man. You shall be pure in all things. You shall not be hasty to give your mouth to an oath, for an oath is a snare of death. You shall not cleave to the doctrine of a double mind, for the teaching of such a mind is not good. You shall not be a lover of money, nor of dress, nor of good eating. You shall eat of everything that is set before you, giving thanks to God. You shall not grudge to give, nor murmur when you give. You shall not be slow to repay a debt. You shall not be a respecter of persons in reproving sin. You shall not be fickle in your mind. You shall not be a whisperer, for the whisperer is a murderer. You shall not be double-tongued, for a double tongue is a snare of death. You shall not be narrow-minded in your hands, but shall stretch them out to your neighbour who is in need. You shall not be slow to give, nor murmuring when you give. You shall not reject a poor man, but shall share all things with your brother, and shall not say that they are your own; for if you are partakers in that which is immortal, how much more in those things which are mortal? You shall not withhold your hands from your son or from your daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them the fear of the Lord. You shall not covet what is your neighbour's, nor shall you be envious of him. You shall not be joined to an angry man. You shall not go with a proud man, but you shall be joined to the just and humble. You shall receive as friends those who are approved, and not as friends those who are approved by others. You shall reprove your neighbour, and not go to sleep with wrath in your heart. You shall not nurse malice. You shall not be of the number of those who lend upon usury, nor of those who take interest. You shall not be a striker, but shall pacify those who strive. You shall be meek, and peaceable, and gentle. You shall fear the Lord's words which you have spoken. You shall not exalt yourself, but shall be humble and lowly in spirit.

You shall not reject a poor man, but shall share all things with your brother, and shall not say that they are your own; for if you are partakers in that which is immortal, how much more in those things which are mortal? You shall not withhold your hands from your son or from your daughter, but from their youth you shall teach them the fear of the Lord. You shall not covet what is your neighbour's, nor shall you be envious of him. You shall not be joined to an angry man. You shall not go with a proud man, but you shall be joined to the just and humble. You shall receive as friends those who are approved, and not as friends those who are approved by others. You shall reprove your neighbour, and not go to sleep with wrath in your heart. You shall not nurse malice. You shall not be of the number of those who lend upon usury, nor of those who take interest. You shall not be a striker, but shall pacify those who strive. You shall be meek, and peaceable, and gentle. You shall fear the Lord's words which you have spoken.

                        A reading from the “Letter to the Ephesians” of St. Ignatius of Antioch, bishop and martyr.<br>
                        I do not command you as Peter and Paul did. They were apostles; I am a condemned man: they were free; I am, even until now, a slave. But if I suffer, I shall be the freedman of Jesus Christ, and shall rise again emancipated in Him. And now, being a prisoner, I learn not to desire anything worldly. And my desire is crucified, and there is in me no fire for material lust, but there is the living water springing up in me and saying within me, "Come to the Father." I have no taste for corruptible food, nor for the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David; and for drink I desire His blood, which is love incorruptible. I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire is to live. And I write to you while I am alive, but I desire to die. My love has been crucified, and there is no fire in me for earthly desires, but there is living water springing up in me, and saying within me, "Come to the Father." I am not willing to live any longer in the manner of men, and my desire is to live. And I write to you while I am still alive, but I desire to die. For my desire is to be poured out as a libation, and to be gathered to the holy ones. While I am still in the flesh, I write to you; I desire to suffer with you, if God should grant it. For I am not willing to live any longer in the manner of men, and my desire is to live. And I write to you while I am still alive, but I desire to die. For my desire is to be poured out as a libation, and to be gathered to the holy ones. While I am still in the flesh, I write to you; I desire to suffer with you, if God should grant it. For I am not willing to live any longer in the manner of men, and my desire is to live. And I write to you while I am still alive, but I desire to die. For my desire is to be poured out as a libation, and to be gathered to the holy ones. While I am still in the flesh, I write to you; I desire to suffer with you, if God should grant it. For I am not willing to live any longer in the manner of men, and my desire is to live. And I write to you while I am still alive, but I desire to die. For my desire is to be poured out as a libation, and to be gathered to the holy ones. While I am still in the flesh, I write to you; I desire to suffer with you, if God should grant it.

                        In these days he went out to the mountain to pray; and all night he continued in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called his disciples; and choosing from them twelve, whom he named apostles, Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came forth from him and healed them all.
