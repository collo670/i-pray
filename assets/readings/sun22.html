                        <em>The kingdoms of Amaziah in Judah and Jeroboam II in Israel.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the second book of Kings.<br>
                        In the second year of Jo'ash the son of Jo'ahaz, king of Israel, Amazi'ah the son of Jo'ash, king of Judah, began to reign. He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jeho-ad'din of Jerusalem. And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet not like David his father; he did in all things as Jo'ash his father had done. But the high places were not removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. And as soon as the royal power was firmly in his hand he killed his servants who had slain the king his father. But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the LORD commanded, "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin."
                        <br><br>
                        He killed ten thousand E'domites in the Valley of Salt and took Sela by storm, and called it Jok'the-el, which is its name to this day. Then Amazi'ah sent messengers to Jeho'ash the son of Jeho'ahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, "Come, let us look one another in the face." And Jeho'ash king of Israel sent word to Amazi'ah king of Judah, "A thistle on Lebanon sent to a cedar on Lebanon, saying, `Give your daughter to my son for a wife'; and a wild beast of Lebanon passed by and trampled down the thistle. You have indeed smitten Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your glory, and stay at home; for why should you provoke trouble so that you fall, you and Judah with you?" But Amazi'ah would not listen. So Jeho'ash king of Israel went up, and he and Amazi'ah king of Judah faced one another in battle at Beth-she'mesh, which belongs to Judah. And Judah was defeated by Israel, and every man fled to his home. And Jeho'ash king of Israel captured Amazi'ah king of Judah... [text continues as in source].

                        <strong>St. Pacian, Discourses on Baptism</strong><br>
                        <em>Pure and immaculate for the day of the Lord.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Discourses on baptism” of St. Pacian, bishop.<br>
                        “Even as we have borne the likeness of the earthly, let us bear also the likeness of the heavenly….The first man was of the earth, earthly; the second man is from heaven, heavenly.” If we act in this manner, dearly beloved brethren, we shall die no more. For even if we are dissolved in this bodily life, we will live in Christ, as he himself has assured us: “He who believes in me, even if he die, shall live.” In a word, we are assured, on God’s word, that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the saints of God live. For God says concerning them: “Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live by him.” And the apostle says of himself: “For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. I desire to depart and to be with Christ.” And elsewhere he says: “While we are in the body we are exiled from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight.”
                        <br><br>
                        This, dearly beloved, is our faith: “If with this life only in view we have had hope in Christ, we are of all men the most to be pitied.” Earthly life, as you yourselves see, for beasts, domestic animals, and the birds of the air is of the same span or longer than ours. What is special to man is what Christ has given him through his Spirit – that is, life everlasting, on condition, however, that we sin no more. For just as death is a penalty of sin and virtue the way to avoid it, so life is conserved by virtue and lost by vice. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is life everlasting in Christ Jesus our Lord.
                        <br><br>
                        Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, we are washed but once; we are only liberated once; we are only received once into the immortal kingdom. It is only once that “Happy is he whose fault is taken away, whose sin is covered.” Hold firm, then, to the gift received, safeguard your joy, and do not commit further sin. Preserve yourselves pure and innocent for the day of the Lord.

                        A reading from the First Letter to Timothy of St. Paul, apostle.<br>
                        Honour widows who are real widows. If a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn their religious duty to their own family and make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. She who is a real widow, and is left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day; whereas she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. Command this, so that they may be without reproach. If any one does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his own family, he has disowned the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
                        <br><br>
                        Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband; and she must be well attested for her good deeds, as one who has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved the afflicted, and devoted herself to doing good in every way. But refuse to enrol younger widows; for when they grow wanton against Christ they desire to marry, and so they incur condemnation for having violated their first pledge...

                        <em>Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the man who humbles himself will be exalted.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Gospel of St. Luke.<br>
                        One Sabbath when he went to dine at the house of a ruler who belonged to the Pharisees, they were watching him. Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose the places of honour, saying to them, "When you are invited by any one to a marriage feast, do not sit down in a place of honour, lest a more eminent man than you be invited by him; and he who invited you both will come and say to you, `Give place to this man,' and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place..."

                        <em>True humility.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Discourse on the Annunciation of the Lord” of St. Aelred, abbot.<br>
                        In truth, brothers, there cannot be true humility in us if it is not nourished by a healthy fear, nor obedience if it is not rendered sweet by the spirit of piety, nor justice if it is not supported by the science of the Spirit, nor patience if it is not sustained by the spirit of strength, nor mercy if it is not illuminated by counsel, nor pureness of heart if it is not preserved by the heavenly things, nor charity if it is not vivified by the wisdom which is the taste for the things of God.
                        <br><br>
                        All this is found in its fullness only in Christ... He manifested humility in his birth because “he undressed himself, assuming the condition of a servant and becoming similar to men he appeared in human form” (Phil 2:7). In the submission to the parents he showed obedience when, abandoning that which was dear to his heart, “he returned to Nazareth and was subjected to them” (Lk. 2:51)...
