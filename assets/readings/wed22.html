                        <em>The faith of Timothy.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Second Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to Timothy.<br>
                        Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. I thank God whom I serve with a clear conscience, as did my fathers, when I remember you constantly in my prayers. As I remember your tears, I long night and day to see you, that I may be filled with joy. I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you. For this reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power and love and self-control. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel in the power of God, who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not in virtue of our works but in virtue of his own purpose and the grace which he gave us in Christ Jesus ages ago, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.

                        <strong>Nm. 10 – 12</strong><br>
                        <em>You are ministers of God and the mouth of Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter to the Ephesians” of St. Ignatius of Antioch, bishop and martyr.<br>
                        And pray without ceasing on behalf of other men; for there is hope of the repentance, that they may attain to God. For “cannot he that falls arise again, and he that goes astray return? For it is fitting that he who has fallen should be raised up, since he is but a man. For this cause the Lord suffered us when we were wandering, that we might return to Him. And He Himself became man, that He might bring back the erring sheep to the fold of His Church. And He sought him, having left the ninety and nine sheep which did not go astray. For He assuredly rejoices more over one that returns with repentance, than over the ninety-nine which have not strayed. And He is the good Shepherd of the sheep. For He laid down His life for His sheep, and restored them to the fold. And He carried Him on His holy back, having come upon him in the mountains and in desert places. For which cause He says, “I am the good Shepherd: I know Mine, and Mine know Me; and I lay down My life for the sheep.” And again He says, “I have other sheep which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, that there may be one fold and one shepherd.” And He is the door of the sheep. And all who came before Him were thieves and robbers. And the sheep did not hear them. For He says, “I am the door: by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.” And again He says, “I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.” Let your present joy, therefore, be in the Lord; and do not love the present joy in the life that now is; and let our present and true joy be only this, to be found in Christ Jesus, that we may truly live. Do not at any time desire so much as even to breathe apart from Him. For He is my hope; He is my boast; He is my never-failing riches, on whose account I bear about with me these bonds from Syria to Rome, these spiritual jewels, in which may I be perfected through your prayers, and become a partaker of the sufferings of Christ, and have fellowship with Him in His death, His resurrection from the dead, and His everlasting life. May I attain to this, so that I may not only speak, but also act, that I may not only be called a Christian, but also be found to be one. For if I shall suffer, I shall then be a disciple of Christ. And let nothing appear to be in me, but Jesus Christ only. For I have no desire to gratify men, but to please God, as also you please Him. I salute you from the city of Smyrna, together with all the holy Churches of God which are with me, being bound in chains for the sake of Jesus Christ, whose bonds from Syria even unto Rome I bear about with me, as spiritual jewels, that I may be perfected through your prayers. I write to you from Smyrna, and I salute you from the Church which is at Smyrna, and from all the other Churches of the Holy God which are with me, being bound in chains for the sake of Jesus Christ, whose bonds from Syria even unto Rome I bear about with me, as spiritual jewels, that I may be perfected through your prayers.

                        <strong>2 Chr. 28: 1 – 27</strong><br>
                        <em>King Ahaz.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the second book of Chronicles.<br>
                        Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as David his father had done, but he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. He even burned his son as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel. And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on the hills, and under every green tree. Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people and carried them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the king of Israel, who defeated him with great slaughter. For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers. And the men of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their kinsmen, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out to meet the army that came to Samaria, and said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage which has reached up to heaven. And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against the LORD your God? Now hear me, and send back the captives whom you have taken from your kinsmen; for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you." Then some of the chiefs of the men of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshil'lemoth, Jehiz'kiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Had'lai, stood up against those who came from the war, and said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here; for you propose to bring upon us a guilt against the LORD by adding to our sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and fierce wrath has fallen upon Israel." So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly. And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the captives, and with the spoil they clothed all that were naked among them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on donkeys, they brought them to their kinsmen at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.

                        <em>The mystery of Christ.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Letter” attributed to Barnabas.<br>
                        Since then, He was manifested in the flesh, and bore our sins upon the cross, and fulfilled all the Scriptures concerning Him, and ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, and is the only Mediator between God and men, and the Advocate with the Father for our sins, and the propitiation for our sins, and the High Priest over the house of God, and the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, and the Author and Finisher of our faith, and the Captain of our salvation, and the Shepherd of the sheep, and the Bishop of our souls, and the Stone which the builders rejected, which has become the head of the corner, and the Foundation which no one can lay besides that which is laid, and the Rock of offence to the disobedient, and the Stone of stumbling, and the living Stone, and the spiritual Rock, and the Stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and the Stone which smote the image, and the Stone which became a great mountain and filled the whole earth, and the Stone which the Lord has laid in Zion, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: and he who believes on Him shall not be put to shame. For He is the living Stone, and we are His spiritual house, built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that you may show forth the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light: for once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. For He has made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Him, to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ. In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will, in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of His glory. And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession—to the praise of His glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us, unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.

                        <strong>Lk. 6: 6 – 11</strong><br>
                        <em>Is it permitted to do good on the Sabbath?</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Gospel of St. Luke.<br>
                        On another sabbath, when he entered the synagogue and taught, a man was there whose right hand was withered. And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Come and stand here." And he rose and stood there. And Jesus said to them, "I ask you, is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?" And he looked around on them all, and said to him, "Stretch out your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored. But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
