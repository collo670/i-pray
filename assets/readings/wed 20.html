                        <strong>Eph. 2:11- 22</strong><br>
                        <em>The pagans reconciled with the Jews and with God.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the Letter of St. Paul, apostle, to the Ephesians.<br>
                        Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called the uncircumcision by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands -- remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who has made us both one, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility, by abolishing in his flesh the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby bringing the hostility to an end. And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.

                        <strong>Book 10</strong><br>
                        <em>Participating at the Eucharistic table, Christ in us and we in Him become only one thing.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Commentary on the Gospel of John” of St. Cyril of Alexandria, bishop.<br>
                        That it may be possible to unite ourselves spiritually to Christ with an interior disposition of perfect charity, with an upright and firm faith, with a sincere soul that desires virtue, is not at all denied by the doctrine of our dogmas: on the contrary we affirm that it teaches us exactly this. Who in fact can doubt, by the strength of that doctrine, that Christ is the vine and we the branches, that from him and for him we have life, from the moment that Paul affirms: “Because there is only one bread, so we even though there are many, we are only one body” in Christ; “all of us in fact participate in only one bread” (1 Cor. 10, 17)? Someone will tell us therefore the cause of the Eucharist and will explain the strength of it. For what reason does it enter into us? Is it not perhaps because Christ lives in us also bodily, through the participation and the communion with his holy body? It is evident: Paul in fact writes that “the Gentiles are called, in Christ Jesus, to participate in the same inheritance, to form the same body and to be participants of the promise by means of the Gospel” (Ep. 3, 6). And in what way have they become the same body? It is through the participation in the sacred Eucharistic table that they are made one body with him, as it happened for each of the apostles. Otherwise for what reason would he call members of Christ his members, that is those of everyone, like his own? He writes in fact: “ Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ? Will you therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!” (1 Cor. 6, 15). The Saviour himself says: “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I in him” (Jn. 6, 56). Worthy of attention is the significance of this work: Christ does not say that he will come in us only through a certain affective relationship, but also through a participation of nature. As in fact if one dissolves on the fire two pieces of wax, of the two he will make one only, in the same way, communicating with the body of Christ and with his precious blood, we become only one thing, he in us and we in him. That which is corruptible by nature cannot be vivified in another way, if it is not united bodily to the body of him who by his very nature is the Life, that is the Only Begotten Son. But if you will not let yourself be persuaded by my words adhere with faith to Christ in person who says: “Truly, truly I say to you: if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you will not have life in you. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day” (Jn. 6, 53-54).

                        <strong>Eccl. 5: 9 – 6:8</strong><br>
                        <em>The vanity of riches.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the book of Ecclesiastes.<br>
                        But in all, a king is an advantage to a land with cultivated fields. He who loves money will not be satisfied with money; nor he who loves wealth, with gain: this also is vanity. When goods increase, they increase who eat them; and what gain has their owner but to see them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a labourer, whether he eats little or much; but the surfeit of the rich will not let him sleep. There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt, and those riches were lost in a bad venture; and he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand. As he came from his mother's womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil, which he may carry away in his hand. This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go; and what gain has he that he toiled for the wind, and spent all his days in darkness and grief, in much vexation and sickness and resentment? Behold, what I have seen to be good and to be fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life which God has given him, for this is his lot. Every man also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and find enjoyment in his toil -- this is the gift of God. For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy upon men: a man to whom God gives wealth, possessions, and honour, so that he lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them; this is vanity; it is a sore affliction. If a man begets a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but he does not enjoy life's good things, and also has no burial, I say that an untimely birth is better off than he. For it comes into vanity and goes into darkness, and in darkness its name is covered; moreover it has not seen the sun or known anything; yet it finds rest rather than he. Even though he should live a thousand years twice told, yet enjoy no good -- do not all go to the one place? All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied. For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?

                        <strong>Commentary on Ecclesiastes by St. Jerome</strong><br>
                        <em>Search for the things of above.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Commentary on Ecclesiastes” of St. Jerome, presbyter.<br>
                        ‘Every man to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and find enjoyment in his toil – this is the gift of God. For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.’ In comparison with the man who feeds upon wealth in the gloom of cares and hoards up perishable things with great heaviness of life, he says that man is better who enjoys his present joys. For in one case there is perhaps little pleasure in enjoyment; but in the other there is only a multitude of cares. And he gives the reasons why it is a gift of God to enjoy wealth. Because ‘he will not much remember the days of his life’. If God calls him away in the happiness of his heart, it will not be in sadness, he will not be troubled by anxiety, taken away in happiness and present pleasure. But it is better that spiritual food and spiritual drink should be understood, according to the words of St. Paul, and to see goodness in all one’s labour, for with great labour and zeal we can behold true goods. And this is our task, that we should rejoice in our zeal and our labour. Even though that is good, until Christ is manifest in our life it is not yet fully good. ‘All the toil of a man is for his mouth, yet his spirit is not filled. For what advantage has the wise man over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living.’ All, over which men labour in the world, is consumed in the mouth, and munched by the teeth, it passes down to the stomach to be digested. For the little while that it delights the appetite, it seems to give pleasure while it is held in the mouth. When it has passed to the belly, there ceases to be any difference between sorts of food. After all this, the soul of the eater is not satisfied; either because it again longs for what it has eaten, and both the wise man and the fool cannot live without food, and the poor man seeks for nothing except how he can keep the organism of his pitiful body alive and not die of hunger, or because the soul gains no advantage from the refreshment of the body and food is the same to the wise man and the fool alike and the poor man goes where he can see wealth. It is better however that we should understand this about the writer of Ecclesiastes who, being learned in the heavenly scriptures, has his labour in his mouth and yet his soul is not satisfied since he always longs to learn. In this matter the wise man has the advantage over the fool, that, when he feels that he is poor (by ‘poor’ we mean the man who is called blessed in the gospel), he hurries to find out those things which pertain to life, and he travels along that narrow, confined path which leads to life, and is poor in evil works, and knows where Christ dwells, who is life.

                    <em>You are envious because I am good.</em><br><br>
                    A reading from the Gospel of St. Matthew.<br>
                    "For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the market place; and to them he said, `You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing; and he said to them, `Why do you stand here idle all day?' They said to him, `Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, `You go into the vineyard too.' And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, `Call the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. Now when the first came, they thought they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. And on receiving it they grumbled at the householder, saying, `These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' But he replied to one of them, `Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you. Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity? ' So the last will be first, and the first last."
