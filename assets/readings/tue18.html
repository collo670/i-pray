                        <strong>1 Kings 22: 1 – 9, 15 – 23, 29, 34 – 38</strong><br>
                        <em>The design of God on Ahab, the impious king, is manifested.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the first book of Kings.<br>
                        For three years Syria and Israel continued without war. But in the third year Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. And the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?" And he said to Jehosh'aphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD." Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramothgilead, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king." But Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?" And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai'ah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil." And Jehosh’aphat said, "Let not the king say so." Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micai'ah the son of Imlah." And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micai'ah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?" And he answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king." But the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?" And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; And the LORD said, `These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'" And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?" And Micai'ah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left; and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another. Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I will entice him.' And the LORD said to him, `By what means?' And he said, `I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.' Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you." So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armour and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded." And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot. And about sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!" So the king died, and was brought to Sama'ria; and they buried the king in Sama'ria. And they washed the chariot by the pool of Sama'ria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD which he had spoken.

                        <strong>Nm. 29 – 30, 34 – 35, 37, 42</strong><br>
                        <em>Catechesis on the post-baptismal rites.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Treatise on the mysteries” of St. Ambrose, bishop.<br>
                        After this, you went up to the priest, consider what followed. Was it not that of which David speaks: “Like the ointment upon the head, which went down to the beard, even Aaron’s beard”? This is the ointment of which Solomon, too, says: “Thy Name is ointment poured out, therefore have the maidens loved You and are drawn to You.” (Song of Songs 1, 3) How many souls regenerated this day have loved You, Lord Jesus, and have said: “Draw us after You, we are running after the odour of Your garments,” (Song of songs 1, 4) that they might drink in the odour of Your resurrection. Consider now why this is done, for “the eyes of a wise man are in his head;” therefore the ointment flows down to the beard, that is to say, to the beauty of youth; and therefore, Aaron’s beard, that we, too, may become a chosen race, priestly and precious, for we are all anointed with spiritual grace for a share in the kingdom of God and in the priesthood. After this white robes were given to you as a sign that you were putting off the covering of sins, and putting on the chaste veil of innocence, of which the prophet said: “You shall sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be cleansed, You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow.” (Ps 50, 9) For he who is baptised is seen to be purified both according to the Law and according to the Gospel: according to the Law, because Moses sprinkled the blood of the lamb with a bunch of hyssop; according to the Gospel, because Christ’s garments were white as snow, when in the Gospel He showed forth the glory of His Resurrection. He, then, whose guilt is remitted is made whiter than snow. So that God said by Isaiah: “Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.” (Is.1, 18) The Church, having put on these garments through the laver of regeneration, (Tit. 3,5) says in the Song of Songs: “I am black and comely, O daughters of Jerusalem.” Black through the frailty of her human condition, comely through the sacrament of faith. And the daughters of Jerusalem beholding these garments say in amazement “Who is this that comes up made white?” She was black, how is she now suddenly made white? But Christ, beholding His Church, for whom He Himself, as you find in the book of the prophet Zechariah, had put on filthy garments, now clothed in white raiment, seeing, that is, a soul pure and washed in the laver of regeneration, says: “Behold, you are fair, My love, behold you are fair, your eyes are like a dove’s,” in the likeness of which the Holy Spirit descended from heaven. The eyes are beautiful like those of a dove, because in the likeness of a dove the Holy Spirit descended from heaven. And then remember that you received the seal of the Spirit; the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness, and the spirit of holy fear, and preserved what you received. God the Father sealed you, Christ the Lord strengthened you, and gave the pledge of the Spirit in your heart, as you have learned in the lesson from the Apostle. (cfr. 2 Cor. 1:22)

                        A reading from the prophet Joel.<br>
                        “Yet even now," says the LORD, "return to me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning; and rend your hearts and not your garments." Return to the LORD, your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love, and repents of evil. Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, a cereal offering and a drink offering for the LORD, your God? Blow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly; gather the people. Sanctify the congregation; assemble the elders; gather the children, even nursing infants. Let the bridegroom leave his room, and the bride her chamber. Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep and say, "Spare your people, O LORD, and make not your heritage a reproach, a byword among the nations. Why should they say among the peoples, `Where is their God?'" Then the LORD became jealous for his land, and had pity on his people. The LORD answered and said to his people, "Behold, I am sending to you grain, wine, and oil, and you will be satisfied; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. "I will remove the northerner far from you, and drive him into a parched and desolate land, his front into the eastern sea, and his rear into the western sea; the stench and foul smell of him will rise, for he has done great things. "Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great things! Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and vine give their full yield. "Be glad, O sons of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD, your God; for he has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for you abundant rain, the early and the latter rain, as before." The threshing floors shall be full of grain, the vats shall overflow with wine and oil. I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you. "You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people shall never again be put to shame. You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is none else. And my people shall never again be put to shame.

                        <em>Love the gifts and the crowns that God has prepared for the champions of justice.</em><br><br>
                        A reading from the “Discourses on baptism” of St. Gregory of Nyssa, bishop.<br>
                        All the saints, because of their trust in God and the free profession of their faith, love dangers and offer their bodies to those who want to tear them to pieces or to kill them in various ways; but they were not defeated or subdued by any difficulty awaiting as a prize for their blood and their glorious undertaking, the beatitudes of the kingdom of heaven. For this Abraham accepted the command to sacrifice his son and Moses suffered in the midst of the extreme difficulties of the desert. Elijah passed in loneliness an existence full of difficulties; and all the prophets, covered with the skins of sheep and goats, lived in afflictions and vexations. For this and for the gospel the evangelists suffered, and the martyrs tolerated the torments of the tyrants. And who is the truly reasonable man, who is the image of God, lover of the heavenly realities, who does not want to even find himself one day among the men who will be resurrected, if he is not found worthy of being praised by God and of receiving honour as a faithful servant. Pushed by this truth, David made his the thirst of the deer, in order to show how great is his desire for God; he desires seeing the face of God in order to enjoy intellectually the embraces. Paul desires to be undressed of the body, as of a heavy and uncomfortable dress, in order to be with Christ: both of them think of the blessed and un-defectable joy. If there is no love for it, all the rest is “vanity of vanities”(Ecl. 1:2). Christian men, participants of the heavenly vocation, flee from a way of thinking that is worthy of delinquents and evil-doers, and do not retain it a fortune to flee from punishment; love instead the gifts and the crown that God has prepared for the champions of justice. Ask without fraud the baptism, receive the talent and be careful not to leave it fruitless; but, as the parable wants, become heads of ten cities (cfr. Lk. 19, 17). He who has let the baptism languish and has hidden the talent under the earth, will certainly hear what was said to the lazy and negligent servant. He who has been illuminated recently, if he has not united the action to the faith, is like one who has committed a crime. He was a slave, guilty of innumerable crimes, in the terror of judgement and of the time in which he would have had to give an account. Suddenly the goodness of God will arrive, he will open the prison, he will free the prisoners. The one who is conceded grace will be praised, conserving in life in His infinite goodness he who had lost the hope of living. He will take consciousness of himself, and live humbly: he will not puff himself up as if he has done I do not know what, because of the fact that his chains have been loosened. The forgiveness of the evil done witnesses to the mercy of Him who has conceded it, and not the claim to righteousness of him who has received it.

                    <strong>Mt. 14: 22 – 36</strong><br><br>
                    A reading from the Gospel of St. Matthew.<br>
                    Then he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, "It is a ghost!" And they cried out for fear. But immediately he spoke to them, saying, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear." And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water." He said, "Come." So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus; but when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me." Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, "O man of little faith, why did you doubt?" And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick, and besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.
