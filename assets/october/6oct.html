                    <strong>Jonah 1: 1 – 2: 1-2, 11</strong><br><br>

                    1 Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying:<br>
                    2 Arise, and go to Ninive the great city, and preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me.<br>
                    3 And Jonas rose up to flee into Tharsis from the face of the Lord, and he went down to Joppe, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tharsis from the face of the Lord.<br>
                    4 But the Lord sent a great wind into the sea: and a great tempest was raised in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.<br>
                    5 And the mariners were afraid, and the men cried to their god: and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship, into the sea, to lighten it of them: and Jonas went down into the inner part of the ship, and fell into a deep sleep.<br>
                    6 And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him: Why art thou fast asleep? rise up, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think of us, that we may not perish.<br>
                    7 And they said every one to his fellow: Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know why this evil is upon us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.<br>
                    8 And they said to him: Tell us for what cause this evil is upon us, what is thy business? of what country art thou? and whither goest thou? or of what people art thou?<br>
                    9 And he said to them: I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord the God of heaven, who made both the sea and the dry land.<br>
                    10 And the men were greatly afraid, and they said to him: Why hast thou done this? (for the men knew that he fled from the face of the Lord: because he had told them.)<br>
                    11 And they said to him: What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea flowed and swelled.<br>
                    12 And he said to them: Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.<br>
                    13 And the men rowed hard to return to land, but they were not able: because the sea tossed and swelled upon them.<br>
                    14 And they cried to the Lord, and said: We beseech thee, O Lord, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased thee.<br>
                    15 And they took Jonas, and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from raging.<br>
                    16 And the men feared the Lord exceedingly, and sacrificed victims to the Lord, and made vows.<br>
                    2:1 Now the Lord prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.<br>
                    2 And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the fish.<br>
                    11 And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonas upon the dry land.

                    3 And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.<br>

                    25 And behold a certain lawyer stood up, tempting him, and saying, Master, what must I do to possess eternal life?<br>
                    26 But he said to him: What is written in the law? how readest thou?<br>
                    27 He answering, said: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thyself.<br>
                    28 And he said to him: Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.<br>
                    29 But he willing to justify himself, said to Jesus: And who is my neighbour?<br>
                    30 And Jesus answering, said: A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who also stripped him, and having wounded him went away, leaving him half dead.<br>
                    31 And it chanced, that a certain priest went down the same way: and seeing him, passed by.<br>
                    32 In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place and saw him, passed by.<br>
                    33 But a certain Samaritan being on his journey, came near him; and seeing him, was moved with compassion.<br>
                    34 And going up to him, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.<br>
                    35 And the next day he took out two pence, and gave to the host, and said: Take care of him; and whatsoever thou shalt spend over and above, I, at my return, will repay thee.<br>
                    36 Which of these three, in thy opinion, was neighbour to him that fell among the robbers?<br>
                    37 But he said: He that shewed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him: Go, and do thou in like manner.
