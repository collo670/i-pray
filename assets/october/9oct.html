                    13 Your words have been unsufferable to me, saith the Lord.<br>
                    14 And you have said: What have we spoken against thee? You have said: He laboureth in vain that serveth God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked sorrowful before the Lord of hosts?<br>
                    15 Wherefore now we call the proud people happy, for they that work wickedness are built up, and they have tempted God and are preserved.<br>
                    16 Then they that feared the Lord spoke every one with his neighbour: and the Lord gave ear, and heard it: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the Lord, and think on his name.<br>
                    17 And they shall be my special possession, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do judgment: and I will spare them, as a man spareth his son that serveth him.<br>
                    18 And you shall return, and shall see the difference between the just and the wicked: and between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not.<br>
                    4:1 For behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace: and all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall set them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, it shall not leave them root, nor branch.<br>
                    2ab But unto you that fear my name, the Sun of justice shall arise, and health in his wings.

                    <em>R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.</em><br><br>

                    1 Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair of pestilence.<br>
                    2 But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he shall meditate day and night.<br>
                    <em>R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.</em><br><br>

                    3 And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whatsoever he shall do shall prosper.<br>
                    <em>R. Blessed are they who hope in the Lord.</em><br><br>

                    4 Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth.<br>
                    6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of the wicked shall perish.<br>

                    6 Because a friend of mine is come off his journey to me, and I have not what to set before him.<br>
                    7 And he from within should answer, and say: Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.<br>
                    8 Yet if he shall continue knocking, I say to you, although he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth.<br>
                    9 And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.<br>
                    10 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.<br>
                    11 And which of you, if he ask his father bread, will he give him a stone? or a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?<br>
                    12 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he reach him a scorpion?<br>
                    13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him?
