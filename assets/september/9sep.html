                    6 As therefore you have received Jesus Christ the Lord, walk ye in him;<br>
                    7 Rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned, abounding in him in thanksgiving.<br>
                    8 Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy, and vain deceit; according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ:<br>
                    9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead corporeally;<br>
                    10 And you are filled in him, who is the head of all principality and power:<br>
                    11 In whom also you are circumcised with circumcision not made by hand, in despoiling of the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ:<br>
                    12 Buried with him in baptism, in whom also you are risen again by the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him up from the dead.<br>
                    13 And you, when you were dead in your sins, and the uncircumcision of your flesh; he hath quickened together with him, forgiving you all offences:<br>
                    14 Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. And he hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross:<br>
                    15 And despoiling the principalities and powers, he hath exposed them confidently in open shew, triumphing over them in himself.
