                    1 I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men:<br>
                    2 For kings, and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.<br>
                    3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,<br>
                    4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.<br>
                    5 For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus:<br>
                    6 Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times.<br>
                    7 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, (I say the truth, I lie not,) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.<br>
                    8 I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.

                    <strong>Luke 16: 1-13</strong><br><br>

                    1 And he said also to his disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward: and the same was accused unto him, that he had wasted his goods.<br>
                    2 And he called him, and said to him: How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship: for now thou canst be steward no longer.<br>
                    3 And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the stewardship? To dig I am not able; to beg I am ashamed.<br>
                    4 I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<br>
                    5 Therefore calling together every one of his lordâ€™s debtors, he said to the first: How much dost thou owe my lord?<br>
                    6 But he said: An hundred barrels of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down quickly, and write fifty.<br>
                    7 Then he said to another: And how much dost thou owe? Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, and write eighty.<br>
                    8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, forasmuch as he had done wisely: for the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.<br>
                    9 And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.<br>
                    10 He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in that which is greater: and he that is unjust in that which is little, is unjust also in that which is greater.<br>
                    11 If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon; who will trust you with that which is the true?<br>
                    12 And if you have not been faithful in that which is anotherâ€™s; who will give you that which is your own?<br>
                    13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.
