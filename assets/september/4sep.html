                    9 Therefore we also, from the day that we heard it, cease not to pray for you, and to beg that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding:<br><br>

                    10 That you may walk worthy of God, in all things pleasing; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God:<br>
                    11 Strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory, in all patience and longsuffering with joy,<br>
                    12 Giving thanks to God the Father, who hath made us worthy to be partakers of the lot of the saints in light:<br>
                    13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love,<br>
                    14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins;

                    <strong>Luke 5: 1-11</strong><br><br>

                    1 And it came to pass, that when the multitudes pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Genesareth,<br>
                    2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.<br>
                    3 And going into one of the ships that was Simon’s, he desired him to draw back a little from the land. And sitting he taught the multitudes out of the ship.<br>
                    4 Now when he had ceased to speak, he said to Simon: Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.<br>
                    5 And Simon answering said to him: Master, we have labored all the night, and have taken nothing: but at thy word I will let down the net.<br>
                    6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a very great multitude of fishes, and their net broke.<br>
                    7 And they beckoned to their partners that were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they were almost sinking.<br>
                    8 Which when Simon Peter saw, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying: Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.<br>
                    9 For he was wholly astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.<br>
                    10 And so were also James and John the sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners. And Jesus saith to Simon: Fear not: from henceforth thou shalt catch men.<br>
                    11 And having brought their ships to land, leaving all things, they followed him.
