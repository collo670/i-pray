                    <strong>Numbers 20: 1-13</strong><br><br>

                    1 And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came into the desert of Sin, in the first month: and the people abode in Cades. And Mary died there, and was buried in the same place.<br><br>

                    2 And the people wanting water, came together against Moses and Aaron:<br>
                    3 And making a sedition, they said: Would God we had perished among our brethren before the Lord.<br>
                    4 Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?<br>
                    5 Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there any water to drink?<br>
                    6 And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon the ground, and cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord God, hear the cry of this people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water, that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur. And the glory of the Lord appeared over them.<br>
                    7 And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<br>
                    8 Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall yield waters. And when thou hast brought forth water out of the rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.<br>
                    9 Moses therefore took the rod, which was before the Lord, as he had commanded him,<br>
                    10 And having gathered together the multitude before the rock, he said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous: Can we bring you forth water out of this rock?<br>
                    11 And when Moses had lifted up his hand, and struck the rock twice with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance, so that the people and their cattle drank,<br>
                    12 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Because you have not believed me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you shall not bring these people into the land, which I will give them.<br>
                    13 This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of Israel strove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.

                    1 Come let us praise the Lord with joy: let us joyfully sing to God our saviour.<br>
                    2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving; and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.<br>

                    7 For he is the Lord our God: and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.<br>

                    8 Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts:<br>
                    9 As in the provocation, according to the day of temptation in the wilderness: where your fathers tempted me, they proved me, and saw my works.<br>

                    <strong>Matthew 16: 13-23</strong><br><br>

                    13 And Jesus came into the quarters of Caesarea Philippi: and he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is?<br>
                    14 But they said: Some John the Baptist, and other some Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets.<br>
                    15 Jesus saith to them: But whom do you say that I am?<br>
                    16 Simon Peter answered and said: Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God.<br>
                    17 And Jesus answering, said to him: Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jona: because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.<br><br>

                    18 And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.<br>
                    19 And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven.<br>
                    20 Then he commanded his disciples, that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.<br>
                    21 From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the ancients and scribes and chief priests, and be put to death, and the third day rise again.<br>
                    22 And Peter taking him, began to rebuke him, saying: Lord, be it far from thee, this shall not be unto thee.<br>
                    23 Who turning, said to Peter: Go behind me, Satan, thou art a scandal unto me: because thou savourest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.
