                    <strong>Numbers 11: 4b-15</strong><br><br>

                    4b The children of Israel also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to eat?<br>
                    5 We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt free cost: the cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.<br>
                    6 Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but manna.<br>
                    7 A Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of bdellium.<br>
                    8 And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.<br>
                    9 And when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the manna also fell with it.<br>
                    10 Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable.<br>
                    11 And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me?<br>
                    12 Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?<br>
                    13 Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat.<br>
                    14 I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.<br>
                    15 But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great evils.

                    13 Which when Jesus had heard, he retired from thence by boat, into a desert place apart, and the multitudes having heard of it, followed him on foot out of the cities.<br>
                    14 And he coming forth saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them, and healed their sick.<br>
                    15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying: This is a desert place, and the hour is now past: send away the multitudes, that going into the towns, they may buy themselves victuals.<br>
                    16 But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give you them to eat.<br>
                    17 They answered him: We have not here, but five loaves, and two fishes.<br>
                    18 He said to them: Bring them hither to me.<br>
                    19 And when he had commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.<br>
                    20 And they did all eat, and were filled. And they took up what remained, twelve full baskets of fragments.<br>
                    21 And the number of them that did eat, was five thousand men, besides women and children.
