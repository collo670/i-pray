                    <strong>Ruth 2: 1-3, 8-11; 4: 13-17</strong><br><br>

                    1 Now her husband Elimelech had a kinsman, a powerful man, and very rich, whose name was Booz.<br><br>

                    2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to her mother in law: If thou wilt, I will go into the field, and glean the ears of corn that escape the hands of the reapers, wheresoever I shall find grace with a householder that will be favourable to me. And she answered her: Go, my daughter.<br>
                    3 She went therefore and gleaned the ears of corn after the reapers. And it happened that the owner of that field was Booz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.<br>
                    8 And Booz said to Ruth: Hear me, daughter, do not go to glean in any other field, and do not depart from this place: but keep with my maids,<br>
                    9 And follow where they reap. For I have charged my young men, not to molest thee: and if thou art thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of the waters whereof the servants drink.<br>
                    10 She fell on her face and worshipping upon the ground, said to him: Whence cometh this to me, that I should find grace before thy eyes, and that thou shouldst vouchsafe to take notice of me a woman of another country?<br>
                    11 And he answered her: All hath been told me, that thou hast done to thy mother in law after the death of thy husband: and how thou hast left thy parents, and the land wherein thou wast born, and art come to a people which thou knewest not heretofore.<br>
                    4:13 Booz therefore took Ruth, and married her: and went in unto her, and the Lord gave her to conceive and to bear a son.<br>
                    14 And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor, that his name should be preserved in Israel.<br>
                    15 And thou shouldst have one to comfort thy soul, and cherish thy old age. For he is born of thy daughter in law: who loveth thee: and is much better to thee, than if thou hadst seven sons.<br>
                    16 And Noemi taking the child laid it in her bosom, and she carried it, and was a nurse unto it.<br>
                    17 And the women her neighbours, congratulating with her and saying: There is a son born to Noemi: called his name Obed: he is the father of Isai, the father of David.

                    1 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples,<br>
                    2 Saying: The scribes and the Pharisees have sitten on the chair of Moses.<br>
                    3 All things therefore whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according to their works do ye not; for they say, and do not.<br>
                    4 For they bind heavy and insupportable burdens, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but with a finger of their own they will not move them.<br>
                    5 And all their works they do for to be seen of men. For they make their phylacteries broad, and enlarge their fringes.<br>

                    8 But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master; and all you are brethren.<br>
                    9 And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.<br>
                    10 Neither be ye called masters; for one is your master, Christ.<br>
                    11 He that is the greatest among you shall be your servant.<br>
