                    <strong>Numbers 12:1-13</strong><br><br>
                    Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman he had married, for he had married an Ethiopian woman.<br><br>
                    And they said: "Is it by Moses alone that the Lord speaks? Does he not speak to us also?" And the Lord heard it.<br><br>
                    Now Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth.<br><br>
                    And immediately the Lord spoke to him, and to Aaron, and to Mary: "Come out you three to the tabernacle of the testimony." And when they were gone out,<br><br>
                    the Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when they were come,<br><br>
                    he said to them: "Hear my words: If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.<br><br>
                    But it is not so with my servant Moses, who is most faithful in all my house.<br><br>
                    For I speak to him mouth to mouth, and plainly, and not by riddles and figures. He sees the Lord's majesty.<br><br>
                    Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?"<br><br>
                    And being angry at them he went away.<br><br>
                    The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed, and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy.<br><br>
                    And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw the leprosy on her face, he said to Moses: "I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have deserved by our folly.<br><br>
                    Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy.<br><br>
                    And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O God, I beseech thee heal her."

                    <strong>Psalms 51: 3-4, 5-6ab, 6cd-7, 12-13</strong><br><br>
                    <em>R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.</em><br><br>
                    Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity.<br><br>
                    Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.<br><br>
                    For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.<br><br>
                    To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged.<br><br>
                    For behold I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me.<br><br>
                    For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.<br><br>
                    <em>R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.</em><br><br>
                    Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.<br><br>
                    To the eyes of the blind thou shalt give light: thou shalt set the bent upright, thou shalt strengthen the weak.<br><br>
                    <em>R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.</em><br><br>
                    Create a clean heart in me, O God, and renew a right spirit within my bowels.<br><br>
                    Cast me not away from thy face, and take not thy holy spirit from me.<br><br>
                    <em>R. Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.</em>

                    <strong>Matthew 14:22-33</strong><br><br>
                    Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and precede him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds.<br><br>
                    After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When it was evening he was there alone.<br><br>
                    Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.<br><br>
                    During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them walking on the sea.<br><br>
                    When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. "It is a ghost," they said, and they cried out in fear.<br><br>
                    At once Jesus spoke to them, "Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid."<br><br>
                    Peter said to him in reply, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water."<br><br>
                    He said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.<br><br>
                    But when he saw how strong the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!"<br><br>
                    Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"<br><br>
                    After they got into the boat, the wind died down.<br><br>
                    Then those in the boat did him homage, saying, "Truly, you are the Son of God."<br><br>
                    <em>Or</em><br><br>
                    <strong>Matthew 15:1-2, 10-14</strong><br><br>
                    Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:<br><br>
                    "Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread."<br><br>
                    And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: "Hear ye and understand.<br><br>
                    Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."<br><br>
                    Then came his disciples, and said to him: "Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?"<br><br>
                    But he answering, said: "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.<br><br>
                    Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit."
