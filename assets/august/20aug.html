                    6 And all the men of Sichem were gathered together, and all the families of the city of Mello: and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak that stood in Sichem.<br><br>

                    7 This being told to Joatham, he went and stood on the top of mount Garizim: and lifting up his voice, he cried, and said: Hear me, ye men of Sichem, so may God hear you.<br>
                    8 The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us.<br>
                    9 And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both gods and men make use of, to come to be promoted among the trees?<br>
                    10 And the trees said to the fig tree: Come thou and reign over us.<br>
                    11 And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other trees?<br>
                    12 And the trees said to the vine: Come thou and reign over us.<br>
                    13 And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that cheereth God and men, and be promoted among the other trees?<br>
                    14 And all the trees said to the bramble: Come thou and reign over us.<br>
                    15 And it answered them: If indeed you mean to make me king, come ye and rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not, let fire come out from the bramble, and devour the cedars of Libanus.

                    <strong>Matthew 20: 1-16</strong><br><br>

                    1 The kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.<br>
                    2 And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.<br>
                    3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.<br>
                    4 And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.<br>
                    5 And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.<br>
                    6 But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?<br>
                    7 They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.<br>
                    8 And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.<br>
                    9 When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.<br>
                    10 But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.<br><br>

                    11 And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,<br>
                    12 Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.<br>
                    13 But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?<br>
                    14 Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.<br>
                    15 Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?<br>
                    16 So shall the last be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.
