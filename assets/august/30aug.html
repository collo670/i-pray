                    9 But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love one another.<br>
                    10 For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound more:<br>
                    11 And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded you.

                    14 For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods;<br><br>

                    15 And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.<br>
                    16 And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five.<br>
                    17 And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.<br>
                    18 But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord’s money.<br>
                    19 But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.<br>
                    20 And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above.<br>
                    21 His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
                    22 And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two.<br>
                    23 His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
                    24 But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.<br>
                    25 And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.<br>
                    26 And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:<br>
                    27 Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.<br>
                    28 Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.<br>
                    29 For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.<br>
                    30 And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
